Non-Sovereign crypto-collateralized yield gold issued as mutually exchangeable digital crypto-tokens and physical notes

What's GLT ?
GLT is a non-sovereign trustless anonymous crypto-backed yield note linked to average global price of physical gold being issued as both digital tokens and physical tokenized crypto notes.

Each physical and physical GLT gold-linked yield note is fully backed by equivalent BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, wBTC and DOTs, all highly liquid cryptocurrencies and stablecoins having multibillion dollar marketcaps. The collateralized cryptoassets backing GLT yield notes are escrowed via an ERC29 smart contract dynamically as per the physical gold price data feeds of a decentralized Oracle.

Transactions in physical GLT yield notes are free, anonymous, and instantaneously final. No need to pay any transaction or mining fees to anyone. GLT is the 21st century yield gold issued in the form of digital cryptotokens and physical cryptonotes embedded on a flexible circuit board, specialized secure element chips, independent NFC interface capable fo powering the secure element and a kill-switch which will be activated in the event of following three triggers:

Event #1
Someone tries to probe it physically with an electron microscope and other instruments.

Event #2
When a hodler/holder decides to convert the physical notes into equivalent digital GLT cryptotokens (ERC20 tokens) and store in his ERC20 compatible cryptowallet.

Event #3
If and when anyone tries out any hardware attack on a physical GLT yield note.
